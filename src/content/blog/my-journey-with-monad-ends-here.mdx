**A cautionary tale about promises, airdrops, and startup culture.**

## The Beginning

I joined Meow Finance (MeowFi) as a Full Stack Developer intern on February 10, 2025, at a stipend of ₹10,000/month. As a final-year student who'd spent four years sharpening my skills with cutting-edge tech, I was ready to build something real. The startup had little more than an idea and a Solidity intern—I was there to build the frontend from scratch.

And build I did. I architected the entire application: TypeScript for type safety, shadcn/ui for components, React Query for data fetching, a feature-based folder structure, and tRPC for the backend. I set up CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and performance optimization. When the team lacked DevOps experience, I hosted the backend on my personal AWS EC2 instance and managed the database server myself. The application was rewritten four times to get it right. It was challenging, but I believed in what we were building.

## The Breakdown

By late June, burnout hit hard. After a production issue on June 27, the pressure broke me. More horrifying than the mental stress was the realization that I couldn't afford my college fees on this stipend. So I made the hard decision to leave and pursue freelance work.

Fifteen days later, a team member reached out. "We got $1M in funding from Monad," they said. "We can offer you a full-time role now." The founder, Harshul Vig, offered me a deal: $160/month (≈₹14,000) until mainnet launch or three months, whichever came first, then a full-time salary of ₹15 LPA. The timeline would let me cover my fees with my first proper paycheck. On July 20, 2025, I signed the offer letter and rejoined.

## The Airdrop & The Illusion

For three months, I rewrote major parts of the application, added features, and prepared for mainnet launch. Then the Monad airdrop happened. I was eligible for 205,000 MON tokens—worth $5,000-10,000 at the time. For a moment, I felt relief.

That relief was short-lived. On October 31, HR (Ishita Magazine) messaged me about setting up a wallet for the "claim portal." **On November 1, she clarified the airdrop was "a building reward for the organization, not for you personally."** They'd randomly used my email, she explained. Despite the tokens being in my personal wallet, accessed via my email, I was told it wasn't mine.

I gave them my seed phrase and asked about my full-time conversion. "They'll get back to me," I was told. Two days later: "We want to onboard you, but it takes time—we're restructuring."

## The Reality Check

After four months of waiting, the "generous offer" arrived on November 15, 2025. **The employment agreement from Trinity Zero Seven Limited (a BVI-registered company) bore no resemblance to the July promises:**

- **$320/month** for a four-month "mentorship period" (not the 3-month transition promised)
- Then **$800/month** thereafter (not ₹15 LPA)
- No benefits, insurance, or leave
- A 12-month term with strict exclusivity clauses
- Token vesting with a 3-month cliff, but only if employed at TGE

The $160/month July offer letter? Signed with Meow Finance/StealMax Technologies Pvt Ltd. The final contract? Trinity Zero Seven Limited. The $16,000/year promise? Nowhere to be found. The 5% core contributor token pool? Vague vesting terms that require me to stay until Token Generation Event or forfeit everything.

**Most telling**: When I asked for updates on November 7, the founder wrote: _"We already have people for the role as we're restructuring the entire company, but we're still open to having you on board since you've been part of one of our brands for some time now."_

## The Patterns

Looking back at the documents, several red flags emerge:

1. **The Airdrop Excuse**: Why would a company airdrop tokens to an employee's personal wallet if they weren't intended for that person? The claim that it was "randomly selected" from the team strains credulity. The fact they needed my seed phrase suggests they couldn't access it otherwise.

2. **The Disappearing Promise**: A signed offer letter is legally binding, yet the terms vanished. The mentorship period, compensation reduction, and BVI jurisdiction (limiting legal recourse) appeared only in the final contract.

3. **Gaslighting Timeline**: Constant delays under "restructuring" while being told "we already have people for the role." If you don't need me, say so. If you do, honor your word.

## Why I'm Writing This

I don't want others to fall into the same trap. Startups often exploit young developers' passion, knowing we're desperate for experience and willing to trust verbal promises. **Get everything in writing. Insist on contracts before work begins. Never host company infrastructure on personal accounts. And never, ever give anyone your seed phrase—even if they claim the assets aren't yours.**

The documents speak for themselves: the July 20, 2025 offer letter promising $16,000/year, the November 15, 2025 contract slashing that to $800/month, and the message trail showing the airdrop contradiction.

For four months, I put my career on hold based on promises. I turned down freelance clients. I managed production systems on my own infrastructure. I gave up a significant token allocation because I believed in doing the right thing.

**Startups: If you can't afford talent, be honest. Don't dangle fake salaries and claim airdrops that land in personal wallets are "company property."**

I don't know why Monad funded this team or how they gained that trust. What I do know is that my journey here ends. The principle is simple: money that isn't mine isn't mine. But promises that were made should be kept.

**Trust is built on actions, not offer letters.**
