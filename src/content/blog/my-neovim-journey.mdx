It seems like every developer I know is talking about **Cursor**. It's the new, AI-powered IDE that’s getting a ton of buzz, and for good reason! I totally get the appeal and its benefits, but I have to be honest: I’m happily sticking with my trusty old friend, **Neovim**.

> **You might be thinking:** "Wait, Neovim? The text-based editor in the terminal? Isn't that what beginners run away from, not towards?"

Well, my journey was a bit different. Neovim was my very first editor when I started learning to code. I didn’t choose it to be a "power user" who never touched a mouse; I chose it out of pure necessity.

### My Unlikely Origin Story

When I first got interested in development, I didn't have a PC. My only tool was my Android phone. I tried every HTML editor in the app store, but they were all clunky and lacked basic functionality. Then, I discovered a game-changing combination: **Termux** (a terminal for Android) and **Neovim**.

Suddenly, I had a real development environment in my pocket. I started using it constantly, always trying to improve my config files. By the time I finally got my first laptop, the habit was already formed. I never even installed VS Code.

### A Journey of Constant Learning (and Struggle)

My Neovim journey wasn't smooth. When I started, many essential plugins were still underdeveloped. Getting things like **Treesitter** and **LSP** set up was incredibly difficult.

Inspired by other developers on GitHub, I started maintaining my own config. It grew slowly over time until, at one point, I had over **150 plugins** working flawlessly together! But after 2-3 years of constant maintenance, I was tired. That’s when I switched to **LazyVim**, a pre-configured Neovim setup that took away the maintenance burden. Even now, I still haven't mastered all the Vim motions, but I'm grasping them little by little.

### Neovim in the Age of AI

Now, let's talk about the AI era. I started using GitHub Copilot in 2023, and from my point of view, it is a great auto-suggestion tool. Yes, nothing more.

I understand that Cursor takes this to the next level with a built-in AI chatbot and agents. That’s a good thing if your only goal is to solve a problem as quickly as possible. But it's different from truly learning and enjoying the process.

> My point is that we shouldn't become deeply dependent on AI, especially when we are learning. Cursor provides tools that make development "easy," but in doing so, it can take away all the fun of learning. It shortcuts the struggle, but the struggle is often where the real understanding is built.

For me, the joy is in the journey—the tinkering, the problem-solving, and the slow, steady process of becoming a better developer. And for that journey, Neovim is the perfect companion.
